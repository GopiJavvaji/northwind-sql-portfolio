# Northwind SQL Portfolio

Business-style SQL analyses on the Northwind dataset (PostgreSQL):
- Joins, CTEs, window functions
- Customer retention, sales trends, sales rep productivity, Pareto (80/20)
- Query optimization with indexes and EXPLAIN ANALYZE

## 📁 Structure
- /queries – practice queries (joins, CTEs, windows)
- /projects – business cases (retention, trends, productivity, Pareto)
- /optimization – indexes + EXPLAIN before/after
- /results – CSVs/screenshots exported from pgAdmin

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Load the Northwind sample into a PostgreSQL DB named `northwind`.
2. Run SQL files from `/queries` and `/projects` in pgAdmin or `psql`.
3. Save outputs (CSV/screenshots) into `/results`.

## 🗺️ Roadmap
- [ ] Joins & CTEs practice
- [ ] Window functions + rolling metrics
- [ ] Customer retention (2024 vs 2025)
- [ ] Monthly sales trends + YoY
- [ ] Indexing & `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` (before/after)
